-- 0031_model_edges.sql
--
-- S1 of the Self-Organizing Substrate plan — unified Model-to-Model
-- edge primitive. Replaces the seven ad-hoc connection mechanisms
-- (supporting_model_ids array, contributing_models array, pattern
-- back-link, archive_reason='superseded' lifecycle flag, latent
-- proposition-encoded edges) with a single typed-edge table whose
-- semantics are declared in `lib/shared/edge_registry.py`.
--
-- (Migration number 0030 was already taken by the audit-chain
-- migration that landed in parallel; this S1 work claims 0031.)
--
-- This migration ALSO drops the CHECK on model_reeval_queue.cause_kind
-- introduced in 0007. The cause_kind taxonomy is now declarative —
-- every edge_kind in the registry contributes its own cause_kind via
-- on_source_archive / on_target_archive callbacks. Hard-coding the
-- five-value enum at the DB layer would block every new edge_kind
-- from cascading. Validation lives in the registry.
--
-- Dual-write phase: arrays remain authoritative during S1. The applier
-- and pattern proposer write to BOTH model_edges AND the legacy
-- arrays. A drift detector worker (services/workers/edge_drift) runs
-- continuously and alarms on divergence. After 14 consecutive days
-- of zero drift, S2 cuts consumers over and S3 drops the array
-- columns. Until then the arrays remain the source of truth.
--
-- Symmetric edge_kinds (none in v1; reserved for future `contradicts`)
-- are stored as TWO rows kept in sync by the EdgesRepo helper, not as
-- a single canonicalized row + CHECK. This eliminates source/target
-- special-casing in every consumer at the cost of negligible storage.
--
-- Idempotent (CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS / CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS).
