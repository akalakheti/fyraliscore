lib/shared/edge_registry.py — declarative registry for Model-to-Model
edge kinds.

Single source of truth for per-kind semantics:

  - direction (directed vs symmetric — the latter stored as 2 rows
    kept in sync by EdgesRepo)
  - DAG / cycle scope (a frozenset of edge_kinds that participate
    jointly in cycle prevention; e.g. `supports` and `instance_of`
    together cannot form a cycle, but `superseded_by` only checks
    against itself)
  - weight rules (required / allowed / forbidden per kind)
  - cascade callbacks invoked when either endpoint of an edge is
    archived (responsible for any model_reeval_queue inserts and
    side effects)
  - mutually_exclusive_with (registry-level invariant: e.g. you
    cannot have a `supports` edge and a future `contradicts` edge
    between the same ordered pair)
  - enabled_for_writes (False for kinds reserved in v1 but not yet
    populated; the repo refuses to insert them until flipped)

Why a registry, not per-table or per-column dispatch:
  Adding a new relationship type should be a ~10-line registry
  patch + a producer, not a schema migration + N consumer changes.
  The whole point of the model_edges unification (migration 0031)
  is to push every "what kind of relationship is this?" decision
  out of SQL and into one declarative module.

Cascade callback contract:
  async def cb(
      conn: asyncpg.Connection,
      archived_model_id: UUID,    # the endpoint that was archived
      other_endpoint_id: UUID,    # the other side of the edge
      edge: dict[str, Any],       # the edge row as a dict
      archive_reason: str,        # the ModelArchiveReason enum value
  ) -> None

  The callback is responsible for any model_reeval_queue inserts.
  It receives the FULL edge row so it can read weight, metadata,
  detected_by — useful for cascade strategies that vary by source
  (e.g., `cascade`-detected edges may be ignored to prevent
  infinite reverberation).

Why callbacks live in this module (not in services/models/edges_repo.py):
  Avoids a circular import. EdgesRepo imports the registry to look
  up specs; the registry's callbacks need to enqueue
  model_reeval_queue rows but can do so via raw SQL on `conn`
  without any repo dependency. Keeping callbacks here makes the
  registry self-contained.

See:
  - db/migrations/0031_model_edges.sql
  - services/models/edges_repo.py (the only writer)
  - services/think/deterministic.py (consumer of the cause_kinds we
    enqueue)
