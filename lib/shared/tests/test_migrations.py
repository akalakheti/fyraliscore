"""Integration tests for lib/shared/migrations.py.

Spec for T3: a migration that fails on its second statement must
roll back the first statement's effects, so the database is
indistinguishable from "migration never ran". The previous
hand-rolled `await conn.execute(file_text)` did NOT do this — it
left statement 1 committed and statement 2's failure poisoned the
connection's transaction state for every subsequent migration.
