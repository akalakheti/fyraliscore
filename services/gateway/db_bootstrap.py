"""services/gateway/db_bootstrap.py — pool bootstrap with JSONB codec.

Wave 1-D flagged that `lib.shared.db.init_pool` does not install a JSONB
codec on new connections; without it, asyncpg returns `jsonb` columns
as `str`, which causes Pydantic hydration to fail downstream (dict
expected). Every production pool used by the Gateway / Ingestion must
install the codec at acquire time.

Two approaches were considered:

  (a) Extend `lib.shared.db.init_pool` with an `init` callback.
  (b) Provide a Gateway-local bootstrap that constructs an asyncpg.Pool
      directly with the `init=` hook.

(b) was chosen because changing the shared library touches other wave-
owned surfaces (risky during parallel Wave 2 work). Tests in this
service also call `_register_codecs` directly on connections they own
(e.g. per-test-transaction pattern), so the codec is installed in both
pool-acquired and test-owned connection paths.

Schema refs: S1.1 `observations.content` / `entities_mentioned` JSONB,
S5.1 `actors.metadata` JSONB, S6.1 `entity_aliases.resolved_entity_ref`.
