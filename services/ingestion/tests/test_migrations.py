"""Gate tests for ingestion migrations 0045-0050 (M1.1).

Verifies:
- All six new migrations apply against a fresh DB, are idempotent on
  re-apply (the project's "rollback" surrogate — see M1 sub-block 1.1
  decision; there is no down-migration infrastructure to test against).
- `onboarding_shards.onboarding_run_id` FK cascades on parent delete.
- RLS policies on `onboarding_runs` isolate rows by `app.current_tenant`.
- The functional index from LLD §1.6 is used by the batched alias query.

Spec: docs/ingestion/03-low-level-design.md §1.1-§1.7.

# cross-tenant reads. Postgres bypasses RLS for SUPERUSER /
# BYPASSRLS roles regardless of `FORCE`; the local dev DB's
# `company_os` user has both attributes, so the behavioural test is
# skipped there (matches the same skip pattern that affects the
# pre-existing lib/shared/tests/test_rls_isolation.py suite). CI is
# expected to use a non-superuser role.
