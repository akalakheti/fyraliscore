"""
services/models/edges_repo.py — repository for the unified
Model-to-Model edge primitive (migration 0031_model_edges.sql).

Single writer for `model_edges`. Every edge mutation in the codebase
goes through this repo; arrays on `models` (supporting_model_ids,
contributing_models) are kept in sync by services/models/repo.py's
`_set_model_relations()` helper, which calls this repo. The drift
detector (services/workers/edge_drift) verifies parity continuously.

Public API:

  EdgesRepo(pool=None)

  .link(conn, *, source, target, kind, tenant_id, detected_by,
        weight=None, metadata=None, created_by_event_id=None)
      Insert one edge (or two for symmetric kinds). Idempotent on
      the (tenant, source, target, kind) UNIQUE; returns the
      inserted-or-existing edge id(s). Validates the kind is
      writable, weight rules, mutually-exclusive-with, and DAG
      cycle scope.

  .unlink(conn, *, source, target, kind, tenant_id)
      Hard DELETE. Used by the diff path inside
      `_set_model_relations` when the array column has shrunk.

  .traverse_forward(conn, *, source, kinds, tenant_id, status='active')
      "What does source relate to via these kinds?" — uses the
      partial index `model_edges_source_idx`.

  .traverse_backward(conn, *, target, kinds, tenant_id, status='active')
      "What relates to target via these kinds?" — uses
      `model_edges_target_idx`. THIS IS THE NEW CAPABILITY S1
      delivers: O(log n) reverse traversal for every kind.

  .mark_inert(conn, *, model_id, tenant_id, reason)
      Set status='inert' on every active edge where this Model is
      either source or target. Called from ModelsRepo.archive() in
      the same transaction.

  .check_no_cycle(conn, *, kind, source, targets, tenant_id)
      Generalized DAG check across the kind's `cycle_scope`. Replaces
      services/models/repo.py:_check_no_support_cycle (which only
      handled `supports`). Recursive CTE over model_edges, scoped to
      the kinds in cycle_scope.

  .get_drift_sample(conn, *, tenant_id, sample_size=200)
      Samples Models and returns (model_id, array_kind,
      array_uuid_set, edge_uuid_set) tuples for drift detection.
      Used only by the drift detector worker.

Why a separate repo (not folded into ModelsRepo):
  Edges are a substrate-level concern with their own lifecycle and
  validation rules. ModelsRepo manages the 9-step model insert
  pipeline; EdgesRepo manages the graph layer. They cooperate via
  the `_set_model_relations` chokepoint helper, which is where the
  dual-write (array + edge) discipline is enforced.

Determinism note:
  Every method that takes a `conn` runs inside the caller's
  transaction; no method opens its own. This is required so dual-write
  with the array column updates is atomic — if the array UPDATE
  commits but the edge INSERT fails, the drift detector will catch
  it, but only after a window of inconsistency. We avoid that
  window by sharing the connection.
