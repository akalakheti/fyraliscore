services/models/repo.py — Models repository.

Schema refs (SCHEMA-LOCK.md):
  - S2.1 `models` table
  - S2.2 indexes on `models`
  - Post-Wave-0 amendments A1-A5 (proposition_kind generated, first-class
    confirmed/contested/last_confirmed/confidence_at_assertion/
    resolved_at/resolution_outcome/activation_coefficient columns,
    CHECK constraints, `deprecated` archive_reason, model_status_notes
    sidecar, no `contesting_actor` column)

Public API per BUILD-PLAN §2 Prompt 1-C + Q3 resolution:

  ModelsRepo(pool, *, embedder=None, tenant_id=...)

  .insert(proposed: ModelCreate, *, conn=None) -> ModelRow
      Nine-step spec pipeline (§2 Process):
        1. Falsifier adequacy if confidence > 0.7
        2. Validate proposition JSON (kind-discriminated union)
        3. apply_calibration (identity in Wave 1)
        4. Clip confidence to [0.05, 0.95]
        5. Validate scope_actors exist
        6. Compute embedding from `natural` (if no vec supplied)
        7. INSERT (proposition_kind is the generated column — never in
           the column list; confidence_at_assertion is written once
           here and never UPDATEd afterwards)
        8. Emit state_change observation (cause_id=born_from_event_id)
        9. Return Model

  .retrieve(ids, *, conn=None) -> list[ModelRow]
      Reconsolidation side effect: last_retrieved_at=now(),
      retrieval_count+=1, activation = LEAST(1.0, activation+0.15).
      confidence NOT touched.

  .archive(model_id, reason, *, conn=None) -> ModelRow
      status='archived', archived_at=now(), archive_reason=reason.
      Emits state_change AND enqueues every active dependent Model
      into `model_reeval_queue` with a cause_kind derived from the
      archive reason (Q8 resolved by migration 0007).

  .search_by_embedding(vec, k, *, filters=None, conn=None)
      HNSW cosine. Excludes status!='active' via the partial index.

  .search_by_scope(*, scope_actors=[], scope_entities=[], conn=None)
      GIN lookups.

  .get_predictions_due(before_ts, *, conn=None)
      evaluate_at <= before_ts AND status='active'.

  .bulk_confidence_update(updates, *, conn=None)
      For the calibration updater. Clips; emits state_change per change.
      NEVER touches confidence_at_assertion.

Q3 translations (baked in here):
  - `confidence_at_assertion` written at INSERT, immutable afterwards —
     never appears in any UPDATE statement this repo runs.
  - `deprecated_at` has no column; callers asking for deprecation pass
    `archive_reason='deprecated'` to `.archive()`.
  - `contesting_actor` is NOT exposed — callers must join observations.
  - `proposition_kind` is a GENERATED column, never in INSERT list.

No mocks. Real Postgres. Embedder may be `None` if the caller supplies
`proposed.embedding` explicitly, or we have a fixture with a hand-built
vector.

# =====================================================================
# PUBLIC API: pgvector pool-shared codec registry
# =====================================================================
#
# `PGVECTOR_REGISTERED_POOL_IDS` is the process-wide set of asyncpg
# connection object ids that have had the pgvector codec registered
# via `pgvector.asyncpg.register_vector(conn)`. Any code that:
#
#   (a) shares an asyncpg pool with `ModelsRepo` (the gateway, the
#       Think worker, the synthesis harness, any test suite), AND
#   (b) wants retrieval Pathway B to bind seed vectors as numpy
#       arrays (the fast path) rather than as `'[…]'::vector` text
#       literals (the slow legacy path),
#
# MUST ensure every pooled connection has been added to this set
# before retrieval reads run on it. The recommended way is to call
# `register_pgvector_on_pool(pool)` once at startup, which hooks
# `register_vector` into the pool's `init` callback and also adds
# the connection's id to this set.
#
# Why a set of int ids and not a WeakSet:
#   asyncpg `PoolConnectionProxy` objects cannot be weak-referenced
#   (they have __slots__), and the set must survive across the
#   `Connection`/`PoolConnectionProxy` boundary. We track raw `id()`
#   values, accepting that the set may transiently retain ids past
#   connection eviction; the bounded clear at 1000 entries handles
#   long-running processes.
#
# Why pool-shared, not per-connection:
#   The codec lives on the asyncpg connection's codec map. asyncpg
#   pools reuse connections across acquisitions, so registering on
#   first use of a connection persists for the connection's lifetime
#   in that pool. Pathway B
#   (services/retrieval/pathways.py:_conn_has_vector_codec) reads
#   this set to decide whether to bind a list of floats (fast,
#   binary) or a stringified `[…]` literal cast as `::vector` (slow,
#   text). If the set says "registered" but the connection's codec
#   was somehow not registered, asyncpg fails with a confusing
#   `could not convert string to float` error — see
#   tests/synthesis_harness/REPORT.md §8 for the full story.
#
# Treat this name as load-bearing. Any new pool that talks to the
# Models surface MUST go through `register_pgvector_on_pool` (or
# replicate its semantics — register the codec and add the
# connection id to this set).
