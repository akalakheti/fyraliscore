"""
services/retrieval/pathways.py — the four primary retrieval pathways.

Spec reference: ARCHITECTURE-FINAL.md §8 "Primary pathway resolver".
BUILD-PLAN reference: §4 Prompt 3.A item 1.

Each pathway is a pure async function that takes a seed + the caller's
asyncpg connection + a tenant_id, hits the DB a small, bounded number
of times, and returns a `PathwayResult`. No pathway mutates any row.
Reconsolidation (calling `ModelsRepo.retrieve`) is the caller's
responsibility — it lives in `primary.py` so second_pass can re-use
the same transaction.

Invariants:
  - Every query filters by `tenant_id` (tenant isolation; spec §26 L1).
  - Every Model query filters by `status='active'` to hit the partial
    indexes (S2.2) and avoid surfacing archived / contested_false /
    superseded Models.
  - Empty seeds return an empty PathwayResult cleanly — never an error.
  - JSONB codec is assumed installed on `conn` by the caller (tests do
    this in conftest; production callers do this via the shared pool
    initializer).

Why this module does not own the pool: retrieval must run INSIDE the
caller's transaction. Think will open one transaction for retrieve +
reason + apply + state_change emission, and we must be on that same
connection so pre-commit state is visible.
