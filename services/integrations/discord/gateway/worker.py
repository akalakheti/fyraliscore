"""services/integrations/discord/gateway/worker.py — long-running worker.

Owns the outer connect → run → reconnect loop. Wraps `DiscordGatewayClient`
with exponential backoff on connection failures, SIGTERM handling, and
process-exit semantics:

  * Clean shutdown (SIGTERM / SIGINT): exit 0.
  * Fatal close (4004, 4010–4014): exit 1; supervisor MUST NOT auto-restart.
  * Configuration error at startup (missing env): exit 2.

This module never imports the websockets library directly — that's
client.py's job. The worker only knows about the client interface.
