# LLD Amendments Pending Next Coherence Audit

Findings surfaced during M1 + M2 implementation that require small
corrections / additions to `docs/ingestion/03-low-level-design.md`
or its sibling docs. None is urgent enough to amend the LLD now;
all should land in the next coherence pass.

---

## 1. §1.6 — Migration 0049 must NOT carry inline `BEGIN/COMMIT`

**Current LLD text:** "this migration uses `BEGIN`/`COMMIT` for the
file structure only — the migration runner must detect
`CONCURRENTLY` and dispatch outside a transaction."

**What we actually implemented (M1.1):**

The runner (`lib/shared/migrations.py:_needs_no_transaction`)
correctly detects `CONCURRENTLY` and skips the txn wrapper. But the
LLD's suggestion to keep inline `BEGIN; … COMMIT;` "for file
structure" is incorrect: an inline explicit `BEGIN` opens a
transaction that Postgres uses for the `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY`
statement, and raises SQLSTATE 25001 ("CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY
cannot run inside a transaction block"), regardless of the runner's
choice to skip its own wrapper.

The actual `db/migrations/0049_entity_aliases_normalized_index.sql`
therefore omits `BEGIN/COMMIT` entirely. The file header documents
this as a deliberate departure from the LLD's literal text.

**Proposed amendment:**

> "this migration is non-transactional. The file omits inline
> `BEGIN/COMMIT` because the runner's non-transactional dispatch
> skips its txn wrapper and an inline explicit `BEGIN` would
> reintroduce the txn that `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` forbids
> (SQLSTATE 25001)."

**Also:** §1.6 should mention the runner's opt-in signal:
`-- migration:no-transaction` (explicit, preferred) with
`CONCURRENTLY` keyword detection as a fallback. 0049 carries the
explicit marker per the M1.1 gate review.

## 2. §13 — `acquire.lua` zero-refill sentinel

**Current LLD text (acquire.lua):** computes
`retry_after_ms = math.ceil(deficit / refill_per_sec * 1000)` with
no guard for `refill_per_sec == 0`.

**What breaks:** with `refill_per_sec=0` and an empty bucket, the
division yields `math.huge` in Lua. Redis cannot serialise infinity
as an integer return value — fakeredis raises
`OverflowError: cannot convert float infinity to integer`; real
Redis (via the C-side response writer) similarly fails.

**What we actually implemented (M1 closeout):**

A guard branch in `acquire.lua` returns the sentinel
`retry_after_ms = -1` meaning "indefinite lockout, not recoverable
on its own." The pre-existing lockout-check branch (step 1) still
runs FIRST, so a caller can clear the sentinel state by issuing a
finite `report_retry_after`. Two unit tests pin the contract:
`test_lua_acquire_zero_refill_denies_with_sentinel` and
`test_lua_zero_refill_cleared_by_report_retry_after`.

**Proposed amendment to §13:**

The script header gets the new retry_after_ms contract:

> retry_after_ms semantics:
>   = 0   on grant.
>   > 0   on deny; ms until the bucket can serve `cost` (or
>         lockout-window remainder, whichever applies).
>   = -1  SENTINEL: indefinite lockout. Returned ONLY when
>         refill_per_sec == 0 and tokens < cost. Callers must
>         handle -1 explicitly; do NOT treat as a sleep duration.

And the new branch in the script body, placed BEFORE the existing
deficit-math statement:

```lua
if refill_per_sec == 0 then
    redis.call('HMSET', KEYS[1],
        'tokens', tokens, 'updated_at_ms', now_ms)
    redis.call('PEXPIRE', KEYS[1], 86400000)
    return {0, tokens, -1}
end
```

**Caller responsibility note:** the LLD §13 Python client contract
(`AcquireResult.retry_after_ms: int`) should also be amended to
state the -1 sentinel and require callers to branch on it. The
M1.3 `client.py` already returns it as-is; callers added in M3+
must handle it.

## 3. Shadow-write ordering relative to inline `ingest()` (M2.1)

**Current spec state:** neither the LLD nor the HLD specifies an
ordering between the shadow write (S3 PUT + Kafka publish) and
the inline `ingest()` call. HLD "Migration Path" step 2 (line
510 of `02-high-level-design.md`) says the router does both "in
addition to" each other, but is silent on order. LLD §5.4 is the
embedding worker pool and is unrelated. M2.1 had to choose; the
choice + reasoning is documented at
[services/webhooks/router.py:741-771](services/webhooks/router.py#L741-L771).

**Decision:** shadow write runs AFTER successful inline `ingest()`,
not before, not in parallel.

**Rationale (verbatim from the code comment):**
1. Inline is the source of truth during M2. Anything that risks
   inline correctness is wrong.
2. Skips wasted shadow writes when inline rejected the payload
   (`PayloadTooLarge` / `ValidationError` / `HandlerNotFound` — all
   caught above and returned as 4xx before reaching the shadow
   block).
3. The observable divergence shape becomes "inline observation
   exists, shadow record missing" — M2.4's E2E test asserts
   against this direction and ops can detect cleanly via count
   comparison. The opposite ordering (shadow first) would let
   transient inline crashes leave orphan shadow records.

**Proposed amendment:** add one paragraph under HLD "Migration
Path" step 2 (or wherever the shadow-path narrative consolidates)
stating: "The shadow write runs after the inline `ingest()`
returns successfully, before the HTTP 200/201 response. Reason:
preserve inline as the source of truth; constrain the observable
divergence shape to 'inline exists, shadow missing' which the E2E
test (M2.4) asserts against."

## 4. Parsed-dict surface → raw bytes contract (M2.2, Discord Gateway)

**Current spec state:** the LLD/HLD describes the shadow path in terms
of "raw body bytes" as if every surface has a wire-level byte stream
available. That is true for HTTP webhook surfaces (`services/webhooks/`)
and the Gmail Pub/Sub push endpoint (raw `request.body()` captured
before JSON parsing). It is NOT true for the Discord Gateway: the WSS
client decodes the JSON frame into a Python dict before the dispatch
layer ever sees it. M2.2 had to choose how to derive the shadow body
for parsed-dict surfaces; the spec doesn't say.

**Decision (M2.2):**

1. **Canonical re-serialisation via orjson.** The Gateway shadow path
   computes `raw_body = orjson.dumps(message, option=OPT_SORT_KEYS)`.
   Sorted keys + orjson's deterministic number/escape formatting give
   byte-equal output for byte-equal logical content, which is what the
   `content_hash` dedup property requires. Discord retransmissions of
   the same message_id arrive byte-identical at the WSS layer, so the
   canonical form also matches across retransmissions.
   See [services/integrations/discord/gateway/dispatch.py:184-244](services/integrations/discord/gateway/dispatch.py#L184-L244).

2. **orjson minor pin.** Because canonical bytes are now part of the
   shadow-path contract (content_hash + N2 replay-from-raw), orjson
   is pinned to `>=3.11,<3.12` in
   [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml). Patch updates are allowed
   (bug fixes only); minor/major bumps must re-run the round-trip
   test below before being accepted. The previous bound (`>=3.9`)
   was a lower-bound-only spec — too loose for replay determinism.

3. **Round-trip property test.** A new test in
   [services/integrations/discord/gateway/tests/test_dispatch_shadow.py](services/integrations/discord/gateway/tests/test_dispatch_shadow.py)
   (`test_gateway_shadow_body_round_trips_through_handler`) invokes
   the production `_maybe_shadow_write_gateway` helper on a fixture
   MESSAGE_CREATE, captures the bytes that landed in S3, replays them
   through `handle_discord_message` from
   `services/ingestion/handlers/discord.py`, and asserts the resulting
   `ObservationDraft` equals the live dispatch's draft. This pins the
   "canonical bytes round-trip through Fyralis's own normalization
   plane" property against future orjson bumps, canonical-form
   refactors, or handler regressions.

**Proposed amendment to LLD §5 (Raw Tier) — new sub-section "Parsed-dict surfaces":**

> Surfaces whose transport delivers parsed structures (Discord Gateway
> WSS, future SDK clients) MUST derive the raw body via canonical
> JSON re-serialisation:
>
> ```python
> raw_body = orjson.dumps(payload, option=orjson.OPT_SORT_KEYS)
> ```
>
> Sorted-keys + orjson's deterministic formatting are the contract
> between the shadow writer and the M6 replay path. orjson MUST be
> minor-pinned in `pyproject.toml`. A round-trip test (parsed-dict →
> canonical bytes → handler → ObservationDraft equal to live) MUST
> exist for each parsed-dict surface.

**Why this matters operationally:** without the canonical form
contract, an orjson minor bump that changes float-formatting or key-
escape behaviour would silently break `content_hash` dedup at the S3
layer (two byte-equal frames would hash differently) and produce
divergent observations on replay (M6 replay-from-raw would write a
different `ObservationDraft` than the original live dispatch).
Locking the form + a property test makes the contract enforced, not
implicit.
