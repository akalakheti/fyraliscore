# Fyralis Ingestion — High-Level Design

**Scope:** Production-grade backfill ingestion pipeline for Slack, GitHub, Discord, Gmail. Adopts the Temporal + Kafka + S3 + Redis stack mandated by the brief. Designed for full-history backfill with a recency-first "feels onboarded" moment in ≤15 minutes, plus steady-state webhook/gateway ingestion converged onto the same data plane. Brownfield: existing handlers, OAuth substrate, and observation schema are preserved; everything else around them is reshaped.

This document answers **why this shape?** Implementation specifics (DDL, activity step-by-step, code shapes) live in `03-low-level-design.md`.

---

## Goals & Non-Goals

### Goals

1. **Backfill-on-install for all four sources.** A newly connected tenant sees recency-prioritised data populating within ≤15 minutes; total backfill completes within 4–8 hours for a typical mid-size tenant; reconciliation confirms coverage ≥99.9% against source-side counts.
2. **Crash-recoverable end-to-end.** Any worker (planner, fetcher, normalizer, writer, embedder) can be killed and restarted without data loss or duplicate observations. Cursors only advance after data is durably persisted.
3. **Replayable from raw.** Every API response and every webhook payload is content-hash-keyed into S3/R2 before any transformation. Re-running normalization on stored raw produces identical observations without re-hitting any source.
4. **Per-tenant fault isolation.** A pathological tenant cannot exhaust rate budget, queue capacity, normalizer CPU, or DB connections for other tenants.
5. **Unified ingestion plane.** Webhook events, Gateway-streamed events, and backfill-fetched events all converge on a single `ingestion.raw` Kafka topic; one normalizer pool processes all three.

### Non-Goals (this design deliberately excludes)

1. **Multi-region active-active.** Single-region; cross-region DR is a Phase-5 concern after we are operationally fluent with this stack.
2. **Schema registry (Avro/Protobuf).** Pydantic v2 models in-repo are the schema; Kafka topics carry JSON; evolution is additive-field-only with a documented compatibility contract.
3. **Custom backpressure protocol.** Kafka consumer-group lag + Temporal task-queue depth are the signals; no application-layer flow control.
4. **Bridge Layer table design.** Per the Phase 1 review, Bridge is greenfield and out of scope. This design names the integration surface (the `onboarding.progress` topic) and stops there.
5. **Workflow versioning beyond Temporal's built-in mechanisms.** Patched workflows use Temporal's `patched()` / `default_version_for_command()`; we do not roll our own.

**Two planes, four layers.**

The **control plane** is Temporal + Postgres metadata + Redis. Temporal owns workflow orchestration and activity scheduling. Postgres holds durable workflow-adjacent state (cursor positions, shard manifests, failure history) plus the existing OAuth substrate. Redis holds ephemeral coordination state: token buckets (one per `(tenant, source, method)`), short-window dedup hints, and the Discord Gateway leader lock.

The **data plane** is S3 + Kafka + worker pools + Postgres `observations`. Raw payloads land in S3 first, then a pointer + idempotency hints publish to `ingestion.raw`. The normalizer pool consumes raw and produces shaped `ObservationDraft` JSON on `ingestion.normalized`. The observation writer consumes normalized and runs the existing `ingest()` core path's persist phase (handler dispatch was already done in normalizer; actor resolve + entity extract + INSERT + T1-trigger enqueue remain). The embedding worker is decoupled onto `ingestion.embedding`.

The **ingress layer** keeps the existing FastAPI webhook router and Gmail Pub/Sub endpoint, but their write target changes: instead of calling `ingest()` inline, they signature-verify, write raw to S3, and publish to `ingestion.raw`. The Discord Gateway worker becomes leader-elected (Redis lock); its received `MESSAGE_CREATE` frames write to the same raw tier and topic as webhooks.

The **downstream layer** is unchanged in shape: existing `NOTIFY observations_new`, existing `think_trigger_queue`, plus a new `onboarding.progress` topic that the Bridge Layer subscribes to.

**The key structural decision:** webhooks and backfill converge at `ingestion.raw`. The normalizer pool, observation writer, and embedding worker do not know or care whether a given message arrived via a real-time push or a historical fetch. This is what lets us reuse 100% of the existing handler logic and observation-insert path while adding a backfill workflow tree above them.

    Note over TMP,KProg: When 80% of recency-bucket-0 shards complete<br/>OR 15 min elapses:
    TMP->>KProg: source.onboarding.feels_onboarded
```

**Narrative:** OAuth completion (existing code, unchanged) triggers a Temporal `TenantOnboardingWorkflow`. That workflow fans out per enabled source. Each `SourceOnboardingWorkflow` calls its planner — a source-specific activity that enumerates the work units (Slack channels, GitHub repos, Gmail mailboxes, Discord channels per guild) and produces a recency-scored shard manifest, persisted to `onboarding_shards`.

The workflow then spawns `ShardFetchWorkflow` children with concurrency capped per (tenant, source) via Temporal semaphores. Each shard workflow runs an inner loop: acquire a rate token from Redis (blocking on `Retry-After` if denied), call the source API, write the raw response to S3 with content-hash keying (PutIfAbsent — duplicate writes are a no-op storage cost), publish a tiny pointer + idempotency hint envelope to `ingestion.raw`, and then advance the shard's cursor in a **separate** Postgres transaction. The separation matters: if the workflow worker crashes between the Kafka publish and the cursor advance, the next retry re-fetches the same page, S3 PutIfAbsent is a no-op, Kafka receives a duplicate envelope, and the normalizer's idempotency key (built from source-stable IDs) ensures zero duplicate observations.

The normalizer pool consumes raw envelopes, pulls the body from S3, dispatches through the existing handler registry to produce `ObservationDraft` JSON, and publishes to `ingestion.normalized` keyed by `tenant_id` (ensures ordering per tenant; cross-tenant work parallelises). The observation writer consumes batches and runs the existing `ingest()` persist path: actor resolve, entity extract, atomic INSERT + `think_trigger_queue` enqueue, post-commit `NOTIFY observations_new`. The embedding worker is decoupled — it consumes a separate topic populated by the writer, calls Ollama, UPDATEs the row, and flips `embedding_pending=FALSE`.

The Bridge Layer subscribes to `onboarding.progress`. The "feels onboarded" event fires when either 80% of the highest-recency bucket has completed OR 15 minutes have elapsed since `tenant.onboarding.started`, whichever first.

### Steady-state flow (Webhook arrival → observation)

```mermaid

    autonumber
    participant Src as External Source
    participant WHR as Webhook Router<br/>(FastAPI)
    participant Sig as Signature Verifier<br/>(existing)
    participant TR as Tenant Resolver<br/>(existing)
    participant S3 as S3 Raw Tier
    participant KRaw as ingestion.raw
    participant Norm as Normalizer Pool
    participant Wr as Observation Writer
    participant DB as Postgres

    Src->>WHR: POST /webhooks/{provider}
    WHR->>Sig: verify(body, headers, secrets)
    Sig-->>WHR: ok | error
    WHR->>TR: resolve(provider, payload, headers)

    WHR->>S3: PutIfAbsent(content_hash)
    WHR->>KRaw: publish(raw_pointer, idem_hints, partition=tenant_id)
    WHR-->>Src: HTTP 200/201

    KRaw->>Norm: same path as backfill
    Norm->>Wr: same path
    Wr->>DB: same path
```

**Narrative:** Identical from `ingestion.raw` onward. The webhook router still does the security work (signature verification, replay-cache check for GitHub, tenant resolution) but stops short of calling `ingest()` synchronously. The HTTP 200 acknowledgment is returned as soon as the raw payload is durable in S3 and the Kafka publish has succeeded. End-to-end p95 (webhook arrival to observation row visible) targets ≤5 seconds; the existing 1.5 s inline target is replaced by a 1.5 s ingress-only target (S3 PutIfAbsent + Kafka publish) plus a separate 2–3 s normalizer-pool processing budget.

The Discord Gateway worker follows the same path: each `MESSAGE_CREATE` frame is written to S3 (keyed by `message.id`-based content hash to be safe under retransmission), envelope published to `ingestion.raw`. The Gmail Pub/Sub endpoint triggers a small Temporal activity (`HistoryDrainActivity`) that runs `users.history.list` and publishes each returned message ID's fetch result into `ingestion.raw`, reusing the same machinery as backfill.

### Workflow tree (Temporal)

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    TOW["TenantOnboardingWorkflow<br/>workflow_id: tenant-{tenant_id}-onboarding"]
    SOW_S["SourceOnboardingWorkflow<br/>workflow_id: ten-{tid}-slack"]
    SOW_G["SourceOnboardingWorkflow<br/>workflow_id: ten-{tid}-github"]
    SOW_D["SourceOnboardingWorkflow<br/>workflow_id: ten-{tid}-discord"]
    SOW_M["SourceOnboardingWorkflow<br/>workflow_id: ten-{tid}-gmail"]
    SFW1["ShardFetchWorkflow<br/>workflow_id: shard-{shard_id}"]
    SFW2["ShardFetchWorkflow"]
    SFW3["ShardFetchWorkflow"]
    RCN["ReconcilerActivity"]

    TOW -->|start child<br/>parent_close_policy=ABANDON| SOW_S
    TOW -->|child| SOW_G
    TOW -->|child| SOW_D
    TOW -->|child| SOW_M

    SOW_S -->|fan out, concurrency-capped| SFW1 & SFW2 & SFW3
    SOW_S -->|on completion| RCN
```

`PARENT_CLOSE_POLICY=ABANDON` on the source-level children means a tenant-workflow restart does not cancel in-flight source backfills. Workflow IDs include `tenant_id` so concurrent installs are trivially isolated and Temporal's per-workflow-id mutex serializes restarts.

---

## Cross-Cutting Decisions

### Idempotency

**Decision:** Preserve the existing source-native identifier choices verbatim. The current codebase already has the right keys; backfill must use the *same* keys so that an event delivered via webhook and the same event later re-fetched by reconciliation produce one observation, not two.

| Source | external_id formula | Source identifier semantics |
|---|---|---|
| Slack | `slack:{channel_id}:{event.ts}` | Slack's `ts` is a microsecond-precise per-channel timestamp string ("1234567890.123456") generated server-side; it is the canonical message identifier and survives edits (the `edited` envelope adds a separate `edited.ts` but the message's own `ts` does not change). Per Slack API docs and current code at [handlers/slack.py:207](services/ingestion/handlers/slack.py#L207). |
| GitHub | `github:{node_id}` for object events; `github:{repo}@{after}` for push | `node_id` is GitHub's GraphQL global identifier — base64-encoded, schema-versioned, globally unique across orgs. For push events the `after` SHA is commit-immutable and `(repo, sha)` is unique. Per current code at [handlers/github.py:216, 256, 304, 352, 415, 461](services/ingestion/handlers/github.py#L216). |
| Discord (interaction) | `discord:interaction:{interaction.id}` | Snowflake (64-bit: timestamp\|worker\|process\|increment). Discord's `id` field is canonical and never reused. Current code at [handlers/discord.py:151-155](services/ingestion/handlers/discord.py#L151-L155). |
| Discord (message) | `discord:message:{message.id}` | Same snowflake semantics. Current code at [handlers/discord.py:269](services/ingestion/handlers/discord.py#L269). |
| Gmail | `gmail:{install_id}:{rfc5322_message_id}` | RFC 5322 §3.6.4: "The Message-ID field provides a unique message identifier that refers to a particular version of a particular message" — globally unique across mailboxes, generated by the originating MTA, survives Gmail's internal `id` churn (label moves, archive/unarchive). Current code at [handlers/gmail.py:180-184, 235](services/ingestion/handlers/gmail.py#L180-L184). |

The `{install_id}` prefix on Gmail scopes the dedup to one Fyralis-managed install — important when one Fyralis instance manages multiple distinct OAuth installs for the same domain (rare but possible during reinstall cycles). Slack/GitHub/Discord do not need the prefix because their identifier spaces are globally unique.

**Backfill-specific concern:** the GitHub `search/issues` API returns issues and PRs that the webhook stream would also deliver. Both produce identical `node_id` external IDs. The observation `UNIQUE(source_channel, external_id, occurred_at)` index drops the second write. The Slack `conversations.history` API returns messages with the same `(channel_id, ts)` pair as the webhook stream — same UNIQUE catches it. No special "is this a backfill or a webhook?" branching is required anywhere downstream.

**Where the existing UNIQUE constraint is wrong:** including `occurred_at` in the unique key means an event whose `occurred_at` changes between two arrivals (theoretical; not observed in any source) would double-insert. The LLD will propose tightening to `UNIQUE(tenant_id, source_channel, external_id)` and adding `tenant_id` to the dedup key — currently the index is global per `source_channel`, which works only because the source-native IDs are themselves globally unique. With `(install_id)` prefixing now standard, the `tenant_id` column is the cleaner scoping; the migration is additive (build new index concurrently, drop old).

### Rate Limiting

**Decision:** Single Redis-resident Lua-scripted token bucket per `(tenant_id, source, method)`, honored by every outbound call from any worker, including backfill fetchers and existing OAuth-callback-time API calls. No per-process counters, no in-memory backoff. The current per-integration ad-hoc 429 retry code is deleted.

**Topology:**

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    W1["Fetcher (backfill)"] -->|EVAL acquire.lua| RDS["Redis<br/>bucket:{tenant}:{src}:{method}"]
    W2["Webhook outbound caller"] --> RDS
    W3["Gmail history poller fetch activity"] --> RDS
    W4["Discord follow-up message worker"] --> RDS
    RDS -->|tokens, retry_after_ms| W1 & W2 & W3 & W4
```

**Lua script (sketch — full version in LLD):**

```lua
-- KEYS[1] = bucket key
-- ARGV[1] = now_ms, ARGV[2] = capacity, ARGV[3] = refill_per_sec, ARGV[4] = cost
-- returns: {granted (0/1), tokens_remaining, retry_after_ms}
local bucket = redis.call('HMGET', KEYS[1], 'tokens', 'updated_at')
local tokens = tonumber(bucket[1]) or tonumber(ARGV[2])
local updated_at = tonumber(bucket[2]) or tonumber(ARGV[1])
local elapsed = tonumber(ARGV[1]) - updated_at
tokens = math.min(tonumber(ARGV[2]), tokens + elapsed * tonumber(ARGV[3]) / 1000)
local cost = tonumber(ARGV[4])
if tokens >= cost then
  tokens = tokens - cost
  redis.call('HMSET', KEYS[1], 'tokens', tokens, 'updated_at', ARGV[1])
  redis.call('PEXPIRE', KEYS[1], 86400000)
  return {1, tokens, 0}
end
local retry_after_ms = math.ceil((cost - tokens) * 1000 / tonumber(ARGV[3]))
return {0, tokens, retry_after_ms}
```

**Retry-After handling:** When a source returns 429 with a `Retry-After` header, the fetcher activity (a) reports the discovered duration back into the bucket as a "lockout" (next acquire is denied for at least `Retry-After` regardless of token math) via a small second Lua script, and (b) raises `RateLimited(retry_after_ms)` which Temporal converts into a workflow-side `await asyncio.sleep(retry_after_ms)` before retrying the activity. This means the source's hint dominates our token math — we never thrash by hammering an exhausted budget.

**Bucket sizing:** Per-source defaults (Slack Tier 3 = 50/min/method, GitHub authenticated REST = 5000/hour, Gmail = 250 quota units/user/sec, Discord = per-bucket dynamic), bucketed at 80% of source limit to leave headroom. Per-tenant overrides allowed for paying-tier customers. Bucket counters are sharded across Redis cluster nodes via `(tenant_id, source)` hash tags — same tenant always lands on same shard.

### Raw Tier

**Decision:** Every inbound byte (webhook body, gateway frame body, API response body) lands in S3/R2 before any transformation. Reprocessing reads from S3, never from sources. This is the single most important capability change vs. today.

**Object key scheme:**

```
s3://fyralis-raw/{env}/{source}/{tenant_id}/{yyyy-mm}/{content_hash[:2]}/{content_hash}.json.zst
```

- `{env}` ∈ {`prod`, `staging`, `dev`}; enables single-bucket multi-env.
- `{source}` ∈ {`slack`, `github`, `discord`, `gmail`}; one prefix per source for IAM and lifecycle policies.
- `{tenant_id}` UUID; enables per-tenant Delete-On-Uninstall via prefix delete.
- `{yyyy-mm}` enables S3 lifecycle rules (e.g., Standard → Glacier after 90 days).
- `{content_hash[:2]}` 2-char prefix shard to spread load across S3 partitions.
- `{content_hash}` = blake2b-160 hex of the raw body bytes. Stable identifier; PutIfAbsent semantics by writing with `If-None-Match: *`.

**Compression:** zstd level 3 by default (single-digit ms encode at ~10 KB/page; ~5–10× ratio for JSON). Compression decision per source-class — Gmail message bodies don't double-compress (already MIME-encoded) but headers do.

**Retention:** 90 days for backfill raw (replayable for reconciliation rerun); 30 days for steady-state raw (replayable for normalizer bug fixes). Both configurable per-tenant for higher-tier customers (think customers with compliance hold needs). Lifecycle rules in S3 handle expiry; no application code involved.

**`ingestion.raw` envelope shape** (the Kafka message body, not the S3 body):

```json
{
  "envelope_version": 1,
  "source": "github",
  "tenant_id": "uuid",
  "raw_s3_key": "s3://...",
  "content_hash": "blake2b-160",
  "ingested_at": "2026-05-17T...",
  "ingress_kind": "webhook|gateway|pubsub|backfill",
  "ingress_metadata": {
    "delivery_id": "X-GitHub-Delivery value",
    "event_type": "pull_request",
    "shard_id": "uuid-or-null",
    "cursor_token": "next-cursor-when-backfill"
  },
  "idem_hints": {
    "expected_external_id_prefix": "github:",
    "expected_source_channel": "github:webhook"
  }
}
```

Envelopes are bounded (~1–4 KB); bodies are pointer-only. This keeps Kafka throughput dominated by message count, not byte count, and lets us scale partitions on message-rate independent of payload size.

### Failure Isolation

**Per-tenant isolation mechanisms:**

1. **Kafka partition affinity.** All `ingestion.*` topics are partitioned by `tenant_id`. A noisy tenant's messages queue up behind their own partition's consumer; other tenants' partitions process independently. Partition count = 64 default (multi-pod consumer parallelism); scale to 256 if heavy tenants concentrate on too few partitions.
2. **Per-tenant Redis token buckets.** Per "Rate Limiting" above. A tenant who exhausts their bucket cannot dilute other tenants' headroom.
3. **Temporal task queue per source, not per tenant.** Workflow IDs include `tenant_id` so Temporal serializes per-tenant; one shared task queue per source gives global concurrency capping (e.g., max 50 in-flight `ShardFetchWorkflow`s on the `github` queue) which we then partition fairly across tenants via the `SourceOnboardingWorkflow`'s semaphore. Per-tenant queues were considered and rejected: queue count grows with tenant count and Temporal sizing becomes awkward.
4. **DB connection pool per worker class.** Observation writer has its own asyncpg pool sized for batch INSERT throughput; embedding worker has its own (lower-throughput, longer-held); planner activities use a small ad-hoc pool. A runaway in one class cannot starve another.
5. **Normalizer process-per-core, OS-level isolation.** A single tenant's CPU-pathological payload (e.g., a giant Slack message) is processed by one process; other processes continue. Failed-process restart is automatic via the pool supervisor.

**DLQ structure:**

- **Kafka topic `ingestion.dlq`**: any normalizer parse failure, observation insert failure (other than UNIQUE violation, which is dedup-correct), or rate-limit-exhausted-beyond-retry-budget publishes a record here. Body includes `raw_s3_key`, `failure_kind`, `error_summary`, `attempt_count`, `last_error_at`.
- **Postgres mirror `ingestion_failures`** (new table, designed in LLD): same fields, plus `resolved_at`, `resolved_by`, `resolution_kind` ∈ {`replayed`, `discarded`, `auto_recovered`}. Ops UIs query this table; the Kafka topic is the durable event log.
- **Replay tool**: a one-shot CLI/Temporal-workflow that reads from `ingestion_failures WHERE resolved_at IS NULL`, fetches the raw payload from S3 by `raw_s3_key`, re-publishes to `ingestion.raw`. The dedup property (source-native external_id) makes this safe to run multiple times.

**What is not isolated:** Postgres itself. A single tenant cannot DOS the database via observations (per-source token bucket caps inbound rate; UNIQUE-violation rollbacks are cheap), but they could via pathological observation content (giant JSONB, huge entity arrays). Hard caps on `content_text` size (32 KB) and `entities_mentioned` length (256 entries) are added in the LLD.

### Reconciliation

**Decision:** At source-onboarding completion, run an authoritative-count comparison and re-shard any gap >0.1%. Reconciliation is a Temporal activity, not a separate workflow — it inherits the parent's retry/failure handling.

**Per-source authoritative count APIs:**

| Source | Count API | Window granularity |
|---|---|---|
| Slack | `conversations.history?channel=X&oldest=&latest=&limit=200` repeated until `has_more=false`; sum message counts | Per-channel time window |
| GitHub | `search/issues?q=repo:X+type:pr+created:..` returns `total_count`; same for `type:issue`; for push events, `repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits?since=&until=` paginated | Per-repo time window |
| Discord | `channels/{id}/messages?before=&after=&limit=100` paginated until empty | Per-channel time window |
| Gmail | `users.messages.list?q=after:...+before:...&maxResults=500` paginated until no `nextPageToken`; sum result counts | Per-mailbox time window |

**Gap detection algorithm:**

1. For each shard (which already has a defined `(start_cursor, end_cursor)` time window):
   - Read `observations_count` from Postgres: `SELECT count(*) FROM observations WHERE source_channel=$1 AND tenant_id=$2 AND occurred_at BETWEEN $3 AND $4`.
   - Read `source_count` from the count API.
   - If `observations_count / source_count < 0.999` AND `(source_count - observations_count) > 5`: emit a reconciliation shard.
2. Reconciliation shards are written to `onboarding_shards` with `kind='reconciliation_resharded'`, `parent_shard_id` set, recency score boosted (so they run ahead of any remaining low-recency backfill).
3. The reconciler exits after writing reconciliation shards; the existing `SourceOnboardingWorkflow` consumes them like any other shard.
4. Reconciliation runs at most twice per `SourceOnboardingWorkflow` execution (configurable). If gaps persist after two passes, the workflow completes with `status='partial'` and an `ingestion_failures` row documents the residual gap for ops review.

**Threshold rationale:** 0.1% (1 in 1000) accounts for legitimate races (a message arriving after our window ended but before the count API observed it) and source-side eventual consistency (Slack and GitHub both have small windows where `search/*` results lag actual events). Below 5 absolute messages we don't reshard — the noise is the signal.

---

## Bridge Layer Integration

**Decision:** Bridge consumes a single Kafka topic, `onboarding.progress`. The design names the contract; the Bridge-side tables and revenue-at-risk computation are out of scope (per Phase 1 Q6).

**Topic shape:** JSON envelopes, partitioned by `tenant_id`, retention 30 days (long enough for any Bridge replay window).

**Event types:**

| Event | When | Body |
|---|---|---|
| `tenant.onboarding.started` | `TenantOnboardingWorkflow` start | `{tenant_id, started_at, sources: [slack, github, ...], eta_minutes}` |
| `source.onboarding.started` | `SourceOnboardingWorkflow` start | `{tenant_id, source, started_at, planned_shard_count}` |
| `source.onboarding.feels_onboarded` | 80% of recency-bucket-0 shards complete OR 15 min elapsed | `{tenant_id, source, observations_count, recency_window_days}` |
| `shard.fetched` | All normalized rows for a shard durable in `observations` | `{tenant_id, source, shard_id, observation_count, fetched_in_seconds}` |
| `source.onboarding.complete` | All shards (incl. reconciliation) done | `{tenant_id, source, total_observations, total_seconds, gaps_resolved}` |
| `tenant.onboarding.complete` | All sources done | `{tenant_id, total_observations, completed_at}` |

**Delivery semantics:** at-least-once. Bridge consumers must dedup on `(event_type, tenant_id, source, shard_id_or_null)`. Idempotent on retry — the same event published twice is identical.

**Failure mode:** Bridge being unavailable does NOT block the ingestion pipeline. Kafka topic retention (30 days) is the buffer; Bridge catches up on restart.

---

## Migration Path from Current State

**Stays unchanged:**

- [services/ingestion/handlers/](services/ingestion/handlers/) — all six handler files (`slack.py`, `github.py`, `discord.py`, `gmail.py`, `linear.py`, `stripe.py`) and the registry. The handler function signature `async def handle(payload, headers) -> ObservationDraft` is the normalizer-pool's contract.
- [services/ingestion/core.py](services/ingestion/core.py) — the `ingest()` function. Becomes called from the observation writer worker instead of the webhook router, but the function itself is unchanged. The atomic INSERT + `think_trigger_queue` enqueue + post-commit NOTIFY pattern is exactly what we want.
- [services/webhooks/signatures/](services/webhooks/signatures/) — all five verifier classes, the `Verifier` Protocol, the registry. Webhook signature verification still happens at the FastAPI ingress.
- [services/webhooks/tenant_resolver.py](services/webhooks/tenant_resolver.py) — DB-backed resolver continues to map (provider, payload, headers) → tenant.
- [lib/shared/secrets/](lib/shared/secrets/) — Fernet envelope encryption, `encrypted_secrets` table.
- All existing OAuth substrate tables (`provider_installations`, `oauth_install_states`, `installation_audit_log`) and the per-integration OAuth callback handlers.
- `observations` table schema (with one additive change — see "tightened UNIQUE" under Idempotency above; LLD covers the index migration).
- `think_trigger_queue` table and the Postgres NOTIFY mechanism.
- All existing per-integration lifecycle handlers (Slack `app_uninstalled`, GitHub `installation.deleted`, Discord outbound 401/403 chokepoint).

**Changes shape (same code purpose, different surroundings):**

- [services/webhooks/router.py](services/webhooks/router.py): the receive endpoint, after signature verification and tenant resolution, **stops calling `ingest()` inline**. Instead it writes raw → S3, publishes envelope → Kafka, returns 200. The provider-specific branches (Slack URL verification, Discord PING, GitHub lifecycle dispatch, GitHub selected_repositories filter) all stay — they happen before the S3 write.
- [services/integrations/discord/gateway/](services/integrations/discord/gateway/) (the Gateway worker): becomes leader-elected via Redis (Redlock-style lease, 30 s TTL, refreshed every 10 s). Session state (`session_id`, `last_seq`, `resume_gateway_url`) is persisted to a new `gateway_session_state` table on every dispatched frame (single UPSERT, ~1 ms; tolerable overhead at the frame rate). On worker crash → restart, the new leader reads the persisted state and resumes.
- [services/integrations/gmail/fetcher.py](services/integrations/gmail/fetcher.py): `drain_mailbox_history` becomes a Temporal activity called by a `GmailHistoryDrainWorkflow` (triggered by both the Pub/Sub push and the scheduled poller). Cursor advancement gets its own activity at last, satisfying the brief's "cursor advancement is a separate Temporal activity" mandate as a first-class property rather than an accidental ordering.
- [services/integrations/gmail/history_poller.py](services/integrations/gmail/history_poller.py) and [watch_scheduler.py](services/integrations/gmail/watch_scheduler.py): become Temporal Schedules (cron-style). Their existing per-mailbox failure-counter logic moves into workflow retry policy. The `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` leasing goes away — Temporal owns the leasing.
- Per-integration outbound clients ([slack/client.py](services/integrations/slack/client.py), [github/client.py](services/integrations/github/client.py), [discord/client.py](services/integrations/discord/client.py), [gmail/client.py](services/integrations/gmail/client.py)): rate-limit code is deleted. A shared `rate_limited()` decorator wraps every outbound call and consults the Redis bucket.

**Gets deleted:**

- [services/webhooks/tenant_resolution.py](services/webhooks/tenant_resolution.py) — dead code per Phase 1 Q2.
- Each integration's ad-hoc 429 / `Retry-After` retry loop (`slack/client.py:160-173`, `github/client.py:442-450`, `discord/client.py:207-224`, `gmail/client.py:124-149`) — replaced by the centralized rate limiter.
- The half-implemented "Follow-up content ships in IN-13" Discord ephemeral response branch at [services/webhooks/router.py:671-682](services/webhooks/router.py#L671-L682) — replaced by a proper `discord-followup` worker that consumes a topic and posts the real follow-up message via `POST /webhooks/{app_id}/{interaction_token}`.
- The GitHub-only in-process replay cache ([services/integrations/github/replay_cache.py](services/integrations/github/replay_cache.py)) — the centralized dedup story (Kafka idem keys + observation UNIQUE) makes this redundant. The cache code stays as a backstop for a transition period (one release cycle) then deletes.
- The `embedding_pending=TRUE` orphan condition becomes impossible: the observation writer publishes an `ingestion.embedding` event for every row where embedding is None, and the embedding worker is the sole writer of `embedding_pending=FALSE`. The existing column stays (read-side filter usage); the new topic is the work signal.

**Gets added (new code and infra):**

- Temporal cluster (single-tenant Temporal server, 3-node Cassandra or RDBMS-backed). Hosted Temporal Cloud is the recommended starting point to avoid operating Temporal yourself in v1.
- Kafka cluster (3-broker minimum, `min.insync.replicas=2`, `acks=all` producer config). Self-hosted or Confluent Cloud.
- Redis (single instance for v1; Redis Cluster when bucket count exceeds single-node memory).
- S3 bucket (`fyralis-raw-{env}`) with lifecycle rules and per-tenant IAM via prefix policies.
- New Postgres tables (designed in LLD): `onboarding_runs`, `onboarding_shards`, `ingestion_failures`, `gateway_session_state`.
- New Python packages:
  - `services/ingestion/workflows/` — Temporal workflow + activity code for the three workflow tiers.
  - `services/ingestion/planners/` — per-source shard planners.
  - `services/ingestion/normalizer/` — multiprocessing pool entry point.
  - `services/ingestion/writers/observation_writer.py` — aiokafka consumer + asyncpg batch insert.
  - `services/ingestion/writers/embedding_worker.py` — aiokafka consumer + Ollama caller.
  - `services/ingestion/raw_tier/` — S3 client wrapper, content-hash helper, envelope schema.
  - `services/ingestion/rate_limit/` — Redis Lua script loader, `rate_limited()` decorator.
  - `services/ingestion/reconciler/` — per-source count APIs and gap-detection logic.
  - `services/ingestion/progress/` — `onboarding.progress` topic publisher.
- New dependencies in `pyproject.toml`: `temporalio>=1.5`, `confluent-kafka-python>=2.3`, `aiokafka>=0.10`, `aioboto3>=12.0`, `redis>=5.0`, `orjson>=3.9`, `zstandard>=0.22` (already present), `opentelemetry-api>=1.20`, `opentelemetry-instrumentation-asyncpg`.

**Migration sequencing (preview — full plan in Phase 4):**

1. **Foundational substrate** (no observable behavior change): provision Temporal, Kafka, Redis, S3; add new dependencies; add new tables; deploy a no-op normalizer worker pool so the topic skeleton is exercised.
2. **Raw tier + Kafka shadow path**: webhook router writes to S3 + publishes to Kafka *in addition to* calling `ingest()` inline. Normalizer pool consumes and asserts observations match. Bug shakedown; no user-visible change.
3. **Embedding worker**: deploy; flip writer-side to publish to `ingestion.embedding`; backfill existing `embedding_pending=TRUE` rows in a one-shot.
4. **Discord Gateway leader-election + session persistence**: net-new behavior; deploy and verify a controlled k8s scale-up does not double-IDENTIFY.
5. **Steady-state cutover**: webhook router stops calling `ingest()` inline; normalizer pool becomes the sole `ingest()` caller. This is the riskiest step; preceded by a 24-hour shadow-read period and a documented rollback plan.
6. **Backfill rollout per source** (in order: Gmail → GitHub → Slack → Discord): per source, deploy planner + ShardFetchWorkflow + reconciler; enable for new installs first; opt-in backfill button for existing tenants.

## What This Design Deliberately Does NOT Include

| Excluded | Why |
|---|---|
| **Multi-region / active-active** | Single-region operation is well-understood; cross-region adds Temporal namespace federation, Kafka MirrorMaker, S3 cross-region replication. None of these are worth the operational tax until we have a customer with regulatory data-residency requirements. Phase 5+. |
| **Schema registry (Confluent Schema Registry / Apicurio)** | Pydantic v2 in-repo is the schema; Kafka payloads are JSON; evolution is additive-field-only enforced by code review. A registry adds a service to operate without buying us anything we don't get from "the producers and consumers ship from one repo." Revisit if we ever consume topics from outside the monorepo. |
| **Per-tenant Kafka clusters** | Partition affinity provides sufficient isolation. Per-tenant clusters would cost $thousands/month per tenant and operationally couple "is this customer's traffic up?" to Kafka cluster health. |
| **Per-tenant Temporal namespaces** | Workflow IDs include `tenant_id`; Temporal serializes per-workflow-id and isolates per-workflow-history. Namespaces are for tenancy at the *cluster* layer — relevant if we ever sell white-label Temporal access (we don't). |
| **Custom application-layer backpressure protocol** | Kafka consumer-group lag IS the backpressure signal. When normalizer lag exceeds 60 s, alert + auto-scale; do not invent a NACK protocol. |
| **Real-time push API for downstream consumers** | Consumers either pull from Kafka (Bridge) or LISTEN on Postgres (`observations_new`, existing). We are not building a customer-facing WebSocket. |
| **Combining the normalizer and observation writer into one process** | The GIL makes JSON parsing + Pydantic validation CPU-bound; the INSERT is I/O-bound. Different scaling profiles. Combining them means you scale on whichever is bottlenecking and waste the other. Brief explicitly mandates multiprocessing for normalizers; we honor that. |
| **Replacing the existing handler registry** | The `@register("slack:message")` decorator pattern + `CHANNEL_TRUST_MAP` is fine. Replacing it with a class hierarchy or dependency-injection container buys nothing concrete and would touch every handler. |
| **A separate "raw tier worker" pool** | The webhook router and the fetcher activities write to S3 directly. Adding an intermediate worker that "owns" raw-tier writes adds latency without isolating any failure mode (the S3 client is the same code either way). |
| **Replaying observations to a "warm" tenant for re-tier-out / re-embedding** | Re-embedding pipeline reads from S3 raw, not from `observations`; observations are the result, not the source of truth. |
| **Bridge Layer table design** | Per Phase 1 Q6: greenfield; defer until Bridge ships. Our contract with Bridge is the `onboarding.progress` topic. |
| **A scheduling tier above Temporal Schedules** | Temporal Schedules cover all our cron needs (Gmail watch renewal, periodic reconciliation). Adding `apscheduler` or a custom scheduler duplicates capability. |
| **Multi-shard Discord Gateway** | Single shard suffices below ~2,500 guilds per [Discord's sharding rules](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway#sharding). When we cross that threshold the design changes (per-shard worker + cross-shard coordination); deferring is cheaper than building speculatively. |
| **Slack-edits / Slack-deletes / Slack-reactions ingestion** | Current handler only processes `message` with `text`. Backfill design depends on the handler shape, which is preserved. Adding edit/delete/reaction support is a parallel workstream (separate handler shapers, separate event types in `_EVENT_SHAPERS`); not in this design. |
| **GitHub event types beyond the existing six** (`release`, `deployment`, `workflow_run`, etc.) | Same reasoning as above. Adding event types is independent of the substrate change. |

## Reconciliation with Phase 1 Findings

Three reminders from Phase 1 that this HLD addresses, and three it deliberately defers:

**Addresses:**

- **Risk #1 (no backfill anywhere)** — entire HLD is the answer.
- **Risk #2 (Gmail cursor advances in separate transaction from inserts)** — solved structurally: cursor advancement becomes its own Temporal activity, ordered after the Kafka publish; the relationship is now a first-class property rather than an accidental ordering.
- **Risk #3 (Discord Gateway session state in-memory only)** — `gateway_session_state` table + Redis leader lock + per-frame UPSERT.
- **Risk #4 (Gmail watch renewal has no recovery path)** — Temporal Schedule with workflow retry policy replaces the asyncio loop; failures retry with exponential backoff; final failure publishes to `ingestion.dlq` + ops alert.
- **Risk #5 (no DLQ for ingestion failures)** — `ingestion.dlq` topic + `ingestion_failures` table.
- **Risk #6 (embedding_pending orphan rows)** — `ingestion.embedding` topic owned by the observation writer; backfill of existing orphans is step 3 of the migration.
- **Risk #7 (raw_payload contract documented but not implemented)** — replaced by the S3 raw tier; the `ObservationDraft.raw_payload` field can be dropped from the LLD's `ObservationDraft` definition.
- **Risk #8 (no rate limiter substrate)** — Redis Lua bucket per `(tenant, source, method)`.

**Deferred:**

- **Risk #9 (Slack handler only accepts `message` with `text`)** — parallel workstream.
- **Risk #10 (no per-tenant key isolation in secret store)** — explicitly acknowledged; per-tenant KEK is a Phase-5 enterprise tier feature; the single-MKEK + RLS design persists.
- **Risk #11 (`unknown_installation` and `disabled` are collapsed)** — deliberate, retained.
- **Risk #14 (no backfill for OAuth-revoke + reinstall)** — partial: reinstall triggers a new `TenantOnboardingWorkflow`, which IS a backfill. The "bridge the gap" question of "fetch the data that arrived during the disconnect window" is a separate feature (requires source-side history that may or may not be available); not in v1.

---

## Open Questions for Phase 3 (LLD)

Recording rather than asking now — these become tradeoff calls in the low-level design and can be locked in there:

1. **Temporal Cloud vs self-hosted Temporal cluster.** Cloud is faster to start, costs ~$200/mo per namespace + per-action pricing. Self-hosted is ~$1.5k/mo of infra and a sustained SRE burden. Recommend Cloud for v1, revisit at scale-out.
2. **Kafka cluster sizing.** 3 brokers × `replication.factor=3` × `min.insync.replicas=2` is the floor. Partition count per topic and retention sizing depend on per-source message rates we don't have empirical numbers for yet; LLD picks defaults and documents the auto-scale knobs.
3. **Multiprocessing normalizer pool sizing.** Per-core defaults work for steady-state; backfill bursts may justify a scale-out signal (lag on `ingestion.raw` > 60 s → spawn N more pods). LLD picks the auto-scaler.
4. **Whether to keep the existing `embedding_pending` column** OR replace it with a "no embedding" signal via column NULLability alone. The column is cheap; recommend keeping for read-side filter compatibility.
5. **Whether reconciliation should compare `observations_count` against a cached per-shard count** or re-aggregate at reconciliation time. Cached is faster but races; re-aggregate is slower but accurate. LLD picks re-aggregate (the latency is bounded; correctness wins).
6. **Whether the Gmail thread canonicalization happens in the normalizer or the observation writer.** Currently in the observation writer (via `dispatch_gmail_message_resource`); the canonical_id UPDATE after INSERT is non-atomic. LLD will move canonicalization into the normalizer so the writer can do a single atomic INSERT with `thread_canonical_id` already set.

---

**End of Phase 2.** Waiting for your review before I start `03-low-level-design.md`. The LLD will be substantially longer (full DDL, workflow code shapes, per-source planner specifics, the ten-failure-mode table, project layout) — let me know if there are decisions in this HLD you want to revisit before I commit to that shape.
